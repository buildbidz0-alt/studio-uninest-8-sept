            <p>
              Uninest was born from our own experiences as students. We juggled multiple apps and websites for everything: one for class notes, another for buying books, and several for social connections. It was disjointed and inefficient. We knew there had to be a better way. We created Uninest to be the single, integrated solution we wish we hadâ€”a place to build community, share knowledge, and make student life easier.
